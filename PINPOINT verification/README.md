Verifying PINPOINT
------------------

The main file is "100by100_without_fault.cir". Towards the end, there are three lines (note: These 3 lines were added _manually_ after a basic circuit file was generated using a Python script.) which represent current drawn by the gates. We comment out lines as necessary. (Depending on the gate which is at fault, subsequent gate may or may not toggle, thus may or may not draw current.)
